# jquery.bubbleMenu

A simple jQuery plugin to pop up a <ul>-based menu when a given element
is clicked. You can style this popup anyway you like. The default style just
has a box with a "speech bubble triangle" on top, positioned to the center
of the element this is attached to.

This is an early draft, and is lacking in plenty of potentially useful options.
YMMV.

My intention was to keep this simple and make the style of the bubble purely
CSS3-based without the need for cutting images or drawing with canvas like
some other similar projects out there.

There is plenty of low-haning fruit in terms of potential improvements that
I'll probably make someday, but only if the need arises. In the meantime,
feel free to fork, patch, and pull-request something if you have a good
feature idea.
